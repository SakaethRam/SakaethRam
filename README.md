# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi, I'm R Sakaeth Ram — A Computer Science Engineer specializing in Cybersecurity, MLOps, and AI-driven system design.


![GitHub CP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4156d4a-d473-4837-9fd3-156ebb975122)


My work blends deep technical expertise in areas like Ethical Hacking, Red Teaming, Cloud Security Architecture, and Machine Learning Engineering, with a sharp focus on building intelligent, scalable, and secure systems for modern digital environments.

Through my academic journey and hands-on engineering roles, I've built and led several full-stack AI and security projects — from multilingual voice assistants and VAPT automation pipelines to grammar-aware NLP engines and behavioral anomaly detectors.

What I Do Here

<> Build & contribute to open-source projects in AI, security, and automation

<> Prototype GPT-style interfaces with context awareness

<> Design and optimize MLOps pipelines with CI/CD and model monitoring

<> Explore secure-by-design development for modern cloud-native applications
